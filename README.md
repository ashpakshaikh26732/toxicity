# 🚀 TensorFlow.js Toxicity Detection  

A web-based toxicity detection project using **TensorFlow.js**. This project utilizes a pre-trained model to classify text as toxic or non-toxic in real-time.  


## 📌 Features  
- 🔥 Detects toxicity in real-time  
- ⚡ Built using TensorFlow.js  
- 🎨 Simple and interactive UI  
- 🌍 Runs completely in the browser (No backend required)  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **TensorFlow.js** – Machine Learning in the browser  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Frontend scripting  
- **HTML & CSS** – UI structure and design  

## 📦 Installation & Setup  

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies** (if applicable)  
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Project**  
   Open `index.html` in your browser or use a local server:  
   ```sh
   npm start  # If using a package like live-server
   ```

## 📜 Usage  
- Enter text in the input field  
- Click the "Check Toxicity" button  
- The model will predict if the text is toxic or not  

## 🧠 How It Works  
This project uses the **Toxicity Classifier** model from TensorFlow.js. The model predicts whether a given text contains **toxic language**, such as threats, insults, obscene content, or identity attacks.
